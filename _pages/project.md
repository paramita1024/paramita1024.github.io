## Current projects
<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

### **Predicting delay in Rail Network**
Here, we study train delay prediction for express trains in Indian Rail Network. This project involves designing transformer-based prediction models in spatio-temporal time series data. 

### **Sustainable AI**
This project explores accelerating LLM inferences for energy optimization and carbon footprint reduction. Towards that, we explore various techniques like output compression, employing energy-optimal assistant models, etc. 

### **Generative models for temporal event data**
This project involves designing TPP-based diffusion models.

### **Explainable AI**
In this project, we are working on developing domain-agnostic attribution techniques and their aplicaiton in diverse domains, namely sequencial data modeling (temporal data models and LLMs in particular), vision, and biology. 

## Projects in PhD tenure
<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

### **Incentive design in unequal competition**
Here, we address the problem of designing dynamic incentives in team-based competitive games where two teams do not have equal capabilities using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. 

### **Human-assisted machine learning models**
Here we address the problem of designing human-assisted machine learning models in a linear regression setup. 

### **Demarcation of Marked Temporal Point Process**
Here we explore various designing algorithms for demarcating heterogenous and homogenous messages from given streamed messages over a network using a marked temporal point process framework.
