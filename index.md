## About Me

I am a PhD scholar in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am working under the supervision of Prof. Niloy Ganguly and Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya in this institute. Also I am currently a part of Complex Networks Research Group at IIT Kharagpur.  My research area is broadly machine learning. I am interested in learning with temporal point processes. I am also interested in the development of various machine learning models that are optimized to operate under different automation levels, broadly putting human in a loop with machine learning systems. I am also interested in recent developments in the area of multi agent reinforcement learning.
