I am currently National Post Doctoral Fellow at Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata. Prior to this, I was Chanakya Post Doctoral Fellow at AI4ICPS Hub Foundation at IIT Kharagpur. I have completed my PhD from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, India, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Niloy Ganguly and Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya as a part of Complex Networks Research Group (CNERG).  

My research area is broadly learing from temporal data. Specifically, my works address various temporal sequence learning problems using marked temporal point process framework. Besides I explore various learning challenges in multi-agent team competitions, where I employ various tools from reinforcement learning framework. I am also interested in the development of various machine learning models that are optimized to operate under different automation levels, broadly putting human in a loop with machine learning systems. 

Prior to this, I have completed my master's degree from the department of Computer Science and Automation at IISc, Bangalore. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree from the department of Information Technology at IIEST, Shibpur.
