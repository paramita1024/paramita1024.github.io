## Paramita Koley

I am a PhD scholar in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am working under the supervision of Prof. Niloy Ganguly and Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya. Also I am currently a part of Complex Networks Research Group at IIT Kharagpur.  My research area is broadly machine learning. I am interested in learning with temporal point processes. Broadly, my works address various robust learning problem in modeling asynchronous temporal sequences. I am also interested in the development of various machine learning models that are optimized to operate under different automation levels, broadly putting human in a loop with machine learning systems. I have also worked in multi-agent reinforcement learning. My works address various learning challenges in multi-agent team competitions. 

Currently, I am part of Complex Networks Research Group at IIT Kharagpur. Prior to this, I have completed my master's degree from the department of Computer Science and Automation at IISc, Bangalore. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree from the department of Information Technology at IIEST, Shibpur.
