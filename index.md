I am currently serving as a SERB National Post Doctoral Fellow at the Machine Intelligence Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, under the guidance of Prof. Malay Bhattacharya. Previously, I was a Chanakya Post Doctoral Fellow at the AI4ICPS Hub Foundation at IIT Kharagpur. I completed my PhD in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where I conducted research under the supervision of Prof. Niloy Ganguly and Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya as part of the Complex Networks Research Group (CNERG).

My research primarily focuses on learning from temporal data. Specifically, I address various challenges in temporal sequence learning using the marked temporal point process framework. Additionally, I explore learning challenges in multi-agent team competitions, employing tools from the reinforcement learning framework. I am also interested in developing machine learning models optimized for operation under different levels of automation, particularly in scenarios that integrate human interaction with machine learning systems.

I received a master's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Automation at IISc, Bangalore, and a bachelor's degree from the Department of Information Technology at IIEST, Shibpur.
