## Projects in PhD tenure
<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

### **Incentive design in unequal competition**
Here, we address the problem of designing dynamic incentives in team-based competitive games where two teams do not have equal capabilities using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. 

### **Human-assisted machine learning models**
Here we address the problem of designing human-assisted machine learning models in a linear regression setup. 

### **Demarcation of Marked Temporal Point Process**
Here we explore various designing algorithms for demarcating heterogenous and homogenous messages from given streamed messages over a network using a marked temporal point process framework. 


## Other Projects

### **Differentiation-based Active Multi-task Learning (during research assistantship at IIT Bombay)** 
Here, we address the problem of active sample selection in a multitask learning problem. We propose a general approach for active selection that can be applied to various multitask learning frameworks, i.e., multitask learning via sharing task relationship matrix or learning shared feature representation. 


## Masters Projects

### **Generative Maximum Entropy Learning for Multiclass Classification (ME Thesis at IISc)** 
Here, we address the feature selection problem in the multiclass problem with many features like text classification with a huge vocabulary.
